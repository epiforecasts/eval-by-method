TODO

Codebase and manuscript structure
- [ ] convert full manuscript into quarto
    - [ ] incorporate results.qmd so all main output is in a single document; either copy in results directly, or use quarto _includes if that compromises readability
    - [ ] Update CLAUDE.md to reflect structural changes

Code functionality
- [ ] check results pipeline runs
- [ ] update the figures
- [ ] fix variant code and data issues

Reporting 
- [ ] create paragraph-by-paragraph one line summary in the `Research-narrative.md`
    - [ ] assess whether the flow of text matches with intended research narrative
    - [ ] compare the text against the STROBE reporting guidelines and flag issues: https://resources.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/#summary 
- [ ] Add mathematical notation for the model in the main text, with explanation
- [ ] flag remaining reviewer comments and suggest actions
- [ ] refactor inline referencing with zotero citation keys (https://www.zotero.org/kathsherratt/library)

Bonus features:
- [ ] create a DAG to represent modelling approach
- [ ] consider removing geographic specificity as an exposure
- [ ] consider identifying the simplest possible version of such a model that can be used to demonstrate the approach, and then build up to the more complex version
