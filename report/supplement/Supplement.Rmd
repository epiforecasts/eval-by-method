# Statistical methods

## Epidemic trend identification

We retrospectively categorised each week as “Stable”, “Decreasing”, or “Increasing”, based on the difference over a three-week moving average of incidence (with a change of +/-5% as “Stable”).

```{r trends,fig.cap="Trends (cases)", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
scores |>
  filter(outcome_target == "Cases") |>
  trends_plot() +
  ggtitle("Cases")
```

```{r death-trends,fig.cap="Trends (deaths)", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
scores |>
  filter(outcome_target == "Deaths") |>
  trends_plot() +
  ggtitle("Deaths")
```

## Model fitting 

```{r model-wis}
results <- readRDS(here("output", "results.rds"))
```

## Model formula

`r results$formula`

## Model diagnostics

### Cases

```{r gamm-diagnostics-cases}
# QQ plot, residuals
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots", "check_Cases.pdf"))
```

### Deaths

```{r gamm-diagnostics-deaths}
# QQ plot, residuals
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots", "check_Deaths.pdf"))
```
