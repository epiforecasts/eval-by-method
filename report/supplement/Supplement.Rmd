# Statistical methods

## Epidemic trend identification

We retrospectively categorised each week as “Stable”, “Decreasing”, or “Increasing”, based on the difference over a three-week moving average of incidence (with a change of +/-5% as “Stable”).

```{r trends,fig.cap="Trends (cases)", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
scores |>
  filter(outcome_target == "Cases") |>
  trends_plot() +
  ggtitle("Cases")
```

```{r death-trends,fig.cap="Trends (deaths)", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
scores |>
  filter(outcome_target == "Deaths") |>
  trends_plot() +
  ggtitle("Deaths")
```

\newpage

## Variant phase identification

```{r variant-phases, fig.cap="Variant phases identified by dominant variant in each location and week"}
variant_phases <- classify_variant_phases() # see: R/utils-variants.R
variant_phases |>
    ggplot(aes(x = target_end_date, y = location, fill = VariantPhase)) +
    geom_tile() +
    scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 2) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = "Location", fill = "Variant phase") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Model fitting 

```{r model-wis}
results <- readRDS(here("output", "results.rds"))
```

### Model formula

`r results$formula`

### Model diagnostics

#### Cases

```{r gamm-diagnostics-cases}
# QQ plot, residuals
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots", "check_Cases.pdf"))
```

#### Deaths

```{r gamm-diagnostics-deaths}
# QQ plot, residuals
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots", "check_Deaths.pdf"))
```

## Model results

### Difference in effects for each modelled variable

```{r plot-model-effects, fig.height = 10, fig.cap = "Effect of counfounding factors on forecast performance (WIS), showing epidemic trend, country location, and dominant variant phase. An effect <0 indicates improved forecast performance relative to other forecast targets. Effects of each variable shown from a univariate model (unadjusted), and in a joint (adjusted) model accounting for all variables."}
plot_effects(results$effects, 
             variables = c("Trend", "Location", "VariantPhase"))
```
